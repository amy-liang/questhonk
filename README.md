# QuestHonk
What UW Quest could have looked like

## Github Pages
https://amy-liang.github.io/questhonk/

## Description
QuestHonk is a simple preview of what Quest could potentially look like - a grid layout dashboard, the black and gold colours representative of UW, and side navgiation. 
The goal of the project was to familiarize myself with pure CSS positioning, basic animations/transitions, and creating a responsive layout.

## Next Steps
- Creating more pages such as the term timetable, course selection etc.
- Adding a sidenav transition
- Using a CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Bulma, UI Kit etc.
